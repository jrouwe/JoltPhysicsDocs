<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md13"></a>
v5.0.0</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md14"></a>
New Functionality</h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md15"></a>
Soft Body</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added soft body skinning constraints. This can be used to limit the movement of soft body vertices based on a skinned mesh. See <a href="https://jrouwe.github.io/JoltPhysics/index.html#skinning-soft-bodies">documentation</a> for more info or watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXw8yMczHJg">movie</a>.</li>
<li>Added ability to turn on/off skinning constraints and to update the max distance for all constraints with a distance multiplier.</li>
<li>Added dihedral bend constraints for soft bodies. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1iswelnGH4">movie</a>.</li>
<li>Added long range attachment constraints (also called tethers) for soft bodies.</li>
<li>Added <a class="el" href="class_soft_body_contact_listener.html">SoftBodyContactListener</a> which allows you to get callbacks for collisions between soft bodies and rigid bodies. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmS_8d2bdOw">movie</a>.</li>
<li>Added support for a vertex radius for soft bodies. This keeps the vertices a fixed distance away from the surface which can be used to avoid z-fighting while rendering the soft body.</li>
<li>Added <a class="el" href="class_soft_body_shared_settings.html#a9880c4cadc96bb24402b3cf3021aff2b">SoftBodySharedSettings::CreateConstraints</a> function that can automatically generate constraints based on the faces of the soft body.</li>
<li>Added ability to update a soft body outside of the physics simulation step using <a class="el" href="class_soft_body_motion_properties.html#ad4d7a9296f3a573698a253763391a2ef">SoftBodyMotionProperties::CustomUpdate</a>. This is e.g. useful if the soft body is teleported and needs to 'settle'.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md16"></a>
Vehicles</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added support for less than 1 collision test per simulation step for vehicle wheels. This behavior can be configured differently when the vehicle is active / inactive. This can be used for LODding vehicles.</li>
<li>Added wheel index to <a class="el" href="class_vehicle_constraint.html#a98e6b9822af90bf4d3a513d04acd5bc8">VehicleConstraint::CombineFunction</a> friction callback and calculating longitudinal and lateral friction in the same call so you can have more differentiation between wheels.</li>
<li>Added ability to override the max tire impulse calculations for wheeled vehicles. See <a class="el" href="class_wheeled_vehicle_controller.html#a8b57f16d22c14cc0fc7a56a81b13aca9">WheeledVehicleController::SetTireMaxImpulseCallback</a>.</li>
<li>Added ability to disable the lean steering limit for the motorcycle, turning this off makes the motorcycle more unstable, but gives you more control over the final steering angle.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md17"></a>
Character</h3>
<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="class_character_virtual.html">CharacterVirtual</a> will now receive an OnContactAdded callback when it collides with a sensor (but will have no further interaction).</li>
<li>Added user data to <a class="el" href="class_character_virtual.html">CharacterVirtual</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md18"></a>
Constraints</h3>
<ul>
<li>Swing limits do not need to be symmetrical anymore for SixDOFConstraints. This requires using the new pyramid shaped swing limits (<a class="el" href="_swing_twist_constraint_part_8h.html#add9e89df628b33308461ef46e1b796b6a5e5b0d93bab61584149905b5e5dc71a0" title="Swing is limited by a pyramid shape, note that this pyramid starts to deform for larger swing angles.">ESwingType::Pyramid</a>). SwingTwistConstraints still requires symmetrical limits but can use the pyramid swing limits too. These are cheaper to evaluate but are less smooth.</li>
<li>Twist limits no longer need to be centered around zero for SixDOFConstraints and SwingTwistConstraints, any value between -PI and PI is supported now.</li>
<li>Changed the meaning of Constraint::mNumVelocity/PositionStepsOverride. Before the number of steps would be the maximum of all constraints and the default value, now an overridden value of 0 means that the constraint uses the default value, otherwise it will use the value as specified. This means that if all constraints in an island have a lower value than the default, we will now use the lower value instead of the default. This allows simulating an island at a lower precision than the default.</li>
<li>Bodies can now also override the default number of solver iterations. This value is used when the body collides with another body and a contact constraint is created (for constraints, the constraint override is always used).</li>
<li>Added fraction hint to <a class="el" href="class_path_constraint_path.html#aa84329614fd89561c555e2af0d4381a2">PathConstraintPath::GetClosestPoint</a>. This can be used to speed up the search along the curve and to disambiguate fractions in case a path reaches the same point multiple times (i.e. a figure-8).</li>
<li>Added <a class="el" href="class_constraint.html#af6f6f7bc9ec10dbaf721515b19241294">Constraint::ResetWarmStart</a> and <a class="el" href="class_ragdoll.html#ab311adf5d4b6bd72199e6d46d04886f8" title="This function calls ResetWarmStart on all constraints. It can be used after calling SetPose to reset ...">Ragdoll::ResetWarmStart</a>. Used to notify the system that the configuration of the bodies and/or constraint has changed enough so that the warm start impulses should not be applied the next frame. You can use this function for example when repositioning a ragdoll through <a class="el" href="class_ragdoll.html#a535e76f7fb7bfee484d82570a3066ae7" title="Set the ragdoll to a pose (calls BodyInterface::SetPositionAndRotation to instantly move the ragdoll)">Ragdoll::SetPose</a> in such a way that the orientation of the bodies completely changes so that the previous frame impulses are no longer a good approximation of what the impulses will be in the next frame.</li>
<li>Multithreading the SetupVelocityConstraints job. This was causing a bottleneck in the case that there are a lot of constraints but very few possible collisions.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md19"></a>
Collision Detection</h3>
<ul>
<li>Created an object layer filter implementation that is similar to Bullet's group &amp; mask filtering, see <a class="el" href="class_object_layer_pair_filter_mask.html">ObjectLayerPairFilterMask</a>.</li>
<li>Created implementations of <a class="el" href="class_broad_phase_layer_interface.html" title="Interface that the application should implement to allow mapping object layers to broadphase layers.">BroadPhaseLayerInterface</a>, <a class="el" href="class_object_vs_broad_phase_layer_filter.html" title="Class to test if an object can collide with a broadphase layer. Used while finding collision pairs.">ObjectVsBroadPhaseLayerFilter</a> and <a class="el" href="class_object_layer_pair_filter.html" title="Filter class to test if two objects can collide based on their object layer. Used while finding colli...">ObjectLayerPairFilter</a> that use a bit table internally. These make it easier to define ObjectLayers and with which object layers they collide.</li>
<li>Renamed SensorDetectsStatic to CollideKinematicVsNonDynamic and made it work for non-sensors. This means that kinematic bodies can now get collision callbacks when they collide with other static / kinematic objects.</li>
<li>Added function to query the bounding box of all bodies in the physics system, see <a class="el" href="class_physics_system.html#a7f87f05d94f62054d6f3e975b613d2f0" title="Get the bounding box of all bodies in the physics system.">PhysicsSystem::GetBounds</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md20"></a>
Simulation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Implemented enhanced internal edge removal algorithm. This should help reduce ghost collisions. See <a class="el" href="class_body_creation_settings.html#a3ff57f2892a515d062718701434601c9" title="Set to indicate that extra effort should be made to try to remove ghost contacts (collisions with int...">BodyCreationSettings::mEnhancedInternalEdgeRemoval</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh5MIiiPVDE">movie</a>.</li>
<li>Added <a class="el" href="class_body_interface.html#a7f730135a74e9cb798d8a7d6c49acefb">BodyInterface::SetUseManifoldReduction</a> which will clear the contact cache and ensure that you get consistent contact callbacks in case the body that you're changing already has contacts.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md21"></a>
Various</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ability to enable gyroscopic forces on bodies to create the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_racket_theorem">Dzhanibekov effect</a>.</li>
<li>Supporting SIMD for WASM build. Use -msimd128 -msse4.2 options with emscripten to enable this.</li>
<li>Allowing WASM build to use a custom memory allocator.</li>
<li>Added <a class="el" href="class_debug_renderer_simple.html">DebugRendererSimple</a> which can be used to simplify the creation of your own <a class="el" href="class_debug_renderer.html">DebugRenderer</a> implementation. It only requires a DrawLine, DrawTriangle and DrawText3D function to be implemented (which can be left empty).</li>
<li>Added ability to update the height field materials after creation.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md22"></a>
Removed functionality</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ability to restrict rotational degrees of freedom in local space, instead this is now done in world space.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md23"></a>
Bug fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in cast sphere vs triangle that could return a false positive hit against a degenerate triangle.</li>
<li>Fixed bug in soft body vs tapered capsule. The calculations were slightly off causing a normal on the top or bottom sphere to be returned while the tapered part was actually closest.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where colliding a cyclinder against a large triangle could return an incorrect contact point.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where soft bodies would collide with sensors as if they were normal bodies.</li>
<li>Sensors will no longer use speculative contacts, so will no longer report contacts before an actual contact is detected.</li>
<li>Hinge limit constraint forces were clamped wrongly when the hinge was exactly at the minimum limit, making it harder to push the hinge towards the maximum limit.</li>
<li>Fixed bug when a body with limited DOFs collides with static. If the resulting contact had an infinite effective mass, we would divide by zero and crash.</li>
<li>Fixed unit tests failing when compiling for 32-bit Linux. The compiler defaults to using x87 instructions in this case which does not work well with the collision detection pipeline. Now defaulting to the SSE instructions.</li>
<li>Fixed assert and improved interaction between a fast moving rigid body of quality LinearCast and a soft body.</li>
<li>When creating a <a class="el" href="class_mesh_shape.html">MeshShape</a> with triangles that have near identical positions it was possible that the degenerate check decided that a triangle was not degenerate while the triangle in fact would be degenerate after vertex quantization. The simulation would crash when colliding with this triangle.</li>
<li>A scaled compound shape with a center of mass of non zero would not apply the correct transform to its sub shapes when colliding with a soft body</li>
<li>A soft body without any edges would hang the solver</li>
<li>Fixed GCC 11.4 warning in <a class="el" href="_job_system_thread_pool_8cpp.html">JobSystemThreadPool.cpp</a>: output may be truncated copying 15 bytes from a string of length 63</li>
<li>Longitudinal friction impulse for wheeled/tracked vehicles could become much higher than the calculated max because each iteration it was clamped to the max friction impulse which meant the total friction impulse could be <a class="el" href="struct_physics_settings.html#a66af679ba7f202b402bb23d0a0e117ad">PhysicsSettings::mNumVelocitySteps</a> times too high.</li>
<li>Properly initializing current engine RPM to min RPM for wheeled/tracked vehicles. When min RPM was lower than the default min RPM the engine would not start at min RPM.</li>
<li>Fixed a possible division by zero in <a class="el" href="class_body.html#aad1ce1d84e95cab008fb239465b3496f" title="Debug function to convert a body back to a body creation settings object to be able to save/recreate ...">Body::GetBodyCreationSettings</a> when the inverse inertia diagonal had 0's.</li>
<li>When specifying a -1 for min/max distance of a distance constraint and the calculated distance is incompatible with the other limit, we'll clamp it to that value now instead of ending up with min &gt; max.</li>
<li>Fixed bug that contact cache was partially uninitialized when colliding two objects with inv mass override of 0. When the contact listener would report a non zero inv mass override the next simulation step this would mean that the simulation would read garbage and potentially crash due to NaNs.</li>
</ul>

<li>Fixed bug in <a class="el" href="class_six_d_o_f_constraint.html#a816d37d27455acd262a58e565445ba8d" title="Restoring state for replay.">SixDOFConstraint::RestoreState</a> that would cause motors to not properly turn on.</li>
<li>Fixed a determinism issue in <a class="el" href="class_character_virtual.html">CharacterVirtual</a>. The order of the contacts returned by GetActiveContacts() was not deterministic.</li>
<li>Fixed issue in sample application that mouse is very sensitive when viewing with Parsec.</li>

v4.0.1</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md28"></a>
New functionality</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ability to stop overriding CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG/CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE which is important for Android as it uses a lot of extra flags. Set the OVERRIDE_CXX_FLAGS=NO cmake flag to enable this.</li>
<li>Reduced size of a contact constraint which saves a bit of memory during simulation.</li>
<li>Can now build a linux shared library using GCC.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md29"></a>
Bug fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed mass scaling (as provided by the <a class="el" href="class_contact_listener.html">ContactListener</a>) not applied correctly to CCD objects &amp; during solve position constraints. This led to kinematic objects being pushed by dynamic objects.</li>
<li>Workaround for MSVC 17.8, limits.h doesn't include corecrt.h and triggers an error that __STDC_WANT_SECURE_LIB__ is not defined.</li>
<li>Fixed bug in MustIncludeC logic in GetClosestPointOnTriangle.</li>

Removed functionality</h2>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>32-bit versions of Android on ARM and x86.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md34"></a>
Bug fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Motor frequency/stiffness of 0 should turn the motor off.</li>
<li><a class="el" href="class_rotated_translated_shape.html#ab7cda756537d468e9260ed98a9ddb523" title="Access the translation that has been applied to the inner shape.">RotatedTranslatedShape::GetPosition</a> returned the wrong value.</li>
<li>If a body is removed between the broad phase detecting an overlap and the narrow phase locking the body, callbacks could be called on a body that has already been removed.</li>
<li>Fixed flipped normals in EPA penetration depth algorithm which could cause the normal to point in the wrong direction for collision tests.</li>
<li>Respecting the IsSensor flag for CCD bodies.</li>
<li>Fixed double locking issue that could cause a deadlock while updating the AABB of a body during simulation.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when fetching a body using an invalid <a class="el" href="class_body_i_d.html" title="ID of a body. This is a way of reasoning about bodies in a multithreaded simulation while avoiding ra...">BodyID</a>.</li>
<li>Windows 32 vs 64-bit versions produce the same deterministic results now.</li>
<li>Heightfield vs convex was not filled in in collision dispatch table. This caused sensors to assert and not detect collisions with heightfields.</li>
<li>The friction applied during continuous collision detection could be sqrt(2) times too large.</li>
<li>The friction was clamped independently on both tangential axis which meant that the total friction could be larger than the amount of friction that should have been allowed. It also meant that an object would slow down quicker on one axis than on another causing a curved trajectory.</li>
